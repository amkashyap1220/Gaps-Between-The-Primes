# Gaps-Between-The-Primes
Gaps Between The Primes is a weekend project, this is a program thats purpose was to solve a maths problem that I came across in a video lecture from Terry Tao. The goal is to find the smallest gap between prime numbers and the largest gap between prime numbers.

If you compile and run the program it will count indefinitly and continue to find and replace the max value between primes. The goal with an infinite amount of computing time and power would get to somewhere in the 200's, as Terry Tao and the Polymath people predict. This mathematical question is talked about in the lecture.
# Why?
I made this program in order to try and practice to use programming to interpret and "solve" the problem given. In this case the problem happened to be a math problem.
