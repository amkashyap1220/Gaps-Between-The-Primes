# Gaps-Between-The-Primes
Gaps Between The Primes is a weekend project, this is a program thats purpose was to solve a maths problem that I came across in a video lecture from Terry Tao. The goal is to find the smallest gap between prime numbers and the largest gap between prime numbers.

If you compile and run the program it will count indefinitly and continue to find and replace the max value between primes. The goal with an infinite amount of computing time and power would get to somewhere in the 200's, as this is where Terry Tao and the Polymath people decided to stop. Most of this is diccused in the lecture.
